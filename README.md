# Wall-E Project Backup

> **Note:** This repository is a **reference resource** for students enrolled in my robotics course. It is not intended to be a complete, plug-and-play solution.

## üìö About This Repository

This repository serves as a **backup** of an ongoing robotics project involving the Wall-E robot platform. It is published to assist students in understanding the structure of a working ROS-based project and to provide a foundation for experimentation, learning, and development.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- This project is **not** a standalone solution.
- It may require:
  - Cloning and setting up additional repositories
  - Editing configuration files
  - Resolving dependencies and environment-specific issues

## üß© Recommended Packages to Clone or Install

The following packages are referenced as **placeholders** in this repository. You will need to manually clone or install them from their respective sources, as shown in class:

- `hector_slam`
- `ros-imu-bno055`
- `slam_gmapping`
- `urdf_tutorial`
- `jetson-inference`

These packages provide additional functionality such as SLAM, IMU integration, URDF modeling, and deep learning inference.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build & Development

- The `build/` and `devel/` folders are **not included** in this repository.
- Any **custom packages** created for this project are included here only as reference material.
- Students are expected to:
  - **Manually recreate these packages** on their own as part of the learning process
  - Use this repository as a **guide**, not a shortcut
- Only the **external packages** demonstrated in class should be cloned using `git clone`.
